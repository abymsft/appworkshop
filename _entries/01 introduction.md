Welcome to the Azure App Service Workshop. In this workshop, you'll go through tasks that will help you master the basic and more advanced topics around [Azure App Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/app-service/) as well as related services.

The workshop will be challenge based, meaning you will get a task to complete and a set of hint and links to complete it. If you would like to follow a more lab based approach, each task will have a step-by-step guide you can unfold. It is not cheating, it is just a different learning style - but try the challenge based approach first.

The workshop will also focus on NO PORTAL - "Friends don't let friends use the portal for provisioning". It is okay to use the portal to view, but all provisioning and changes should be made to automate. Spend a few minutes extra - it will pay off in the long run. The examples in the workshop will focus on CLI, but if you are more comfortable with PowerShell or want to try Azure Resource Management templates - give it a go.

You can review the [changelog](#changelog) for what has recently changed.
